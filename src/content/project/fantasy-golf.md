## The What
Fantasy Football has been around for years and has it's own dedicated services...why not golf? With this app create and manage your own fantasy golf league with your own set of custom rules.
Don't want to deal with setting the rules? Don't worry just use one of our default sets.

## Stack
- Flutter for MVP (May stay here)
- React Native (May move to here)
- Firebase for Auth and RealTime DB

## Roadmap
