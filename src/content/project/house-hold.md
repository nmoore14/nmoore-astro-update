## The What
The honey-do-list to end all honey-do-lists. Track what projects need to be done around the house and by who and quickly add the projects to your calendar to help schedule your day.
Inside of each project, set goals, steps, and even take notes to access at a later time to help get the project done quicker the next time it needs to be done.
